# Challenge 03 — Discover Operational Skills

> **Capabilities added in this challenge**: Skills

## Introduction

Your agent can answer questions from documentation (Challenge 02) but it cannot *act*. Ask it to run a KQL query or check a Container App's health and it will describe what it would do — but it can't actually do it, because it has no tools.

**Skills** unlock action. Each skill is a YAML file that packages a named investigation procedure, a constrained set of tools (specific `az` commands, KQL queries, REST calls), and a safety posture into a reusable capability. When a skill is loaded, the agent can execute that procedure — following the runbook, calling only the allowed tools, producing a consistent result.

## Description

### Step 1 — Ask the agent to investigate (before skills)

In the SRE Agent portal, ask:

```text
Investigate the current health of the Grubify Container App. Check for any active errors or anomalies.
```

Note the response. The agent knows *how* to investigate (from its knowledge documents) but cannot actually run any queries or commands. It's like asking an expert to examine a patient but not allowing them to touch anything.

Also ask:

```text
Show me the denied network flows in the last hour.
```

Same problem — the agent knows what Traffic Analytics is, but has no tools to query it.

### Step 2 — Add the skills

Apply the skill YAMLs from `Student/Resources/azure-sre-agent-config/skills/`:

```bash
make skills
```

Verify custom skills under **Skills** in the portal — you should see 9 skills listed.

### Step 3 — Ask the same questions again

```text
Investigate the current health of the Grubify Container App. Check for any active errors or anomalies.
```

Now the agent should:

- Invoke the `sample-food-container-app-incident-analysis` skill
- Run actual KQL queries against Container Apps HTTP logs and Application Insights
- Return real data from your lab environment

```text
Show me the denied network flows in the last hour.
```

Now the agent should:

- Invoke the `traffic-analytics-kql-analysis` skill
- Query `NTANetAnalytics` in Log Analytics
- Return actual flow data (or confirm no denied flows if the lab is clean)

### Step 4 — List what skills were loaded

```text
What skills do you have loaded? For each one, describe its purpose and the tools it uses.
```

### Step 5 — Probe the safety boundary

```text
If you found the root cause was an NSG deny rule, could you delete the rule right now without asking me?
```

This surfaces the boundary between autonomous action and approval-gated action. The agent should
explain that skills only declare read/write tools and a natural-language runbook — there is no
`safety` block on the skill itself. Autonomy is governed elsewhere: by which tools a skill lists
(e.g. `RunAzCliReadCommands` vs. write commands), by the subagent's own instructions, and by the
`agentMode` (`Review` vs. `Autonomous`) set on the incident filter or scheduled task that invokes it.

### Step 6 — Read a skill definition in the portal

In the portal under **Skills**, click on `connectivity-diagnostics` to view its definition. Note the `tools` list and the runbook steps referenced in its files.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Before adding skills, the agent describes investigation steps but cannot execute any
- [ ] After adding skills, the agent runs real KQL queries and returns data from the lab
- [ ] The agent lists all 9 loaded skills with correct names and purposes
- [ ] The agent correctly describes what requires approval vs. what it can do autonomously
- [ ] **Explain to your coach** — why do skills list tools explicitly rather than giving the agent all tools? What is the security benefit of this constraint?

## Tips

- Skills work together with knowledge documents: the skill provides the tool grants, the knowledge doc provides the runbook steps. Separate them cleanly — tool policy in YAML, content in Markdown.
- The `description` field is the routing signal: the agent picks which skill to use based on this description. Make it specific.
- After this challenge: the agent can query Azure-native telemetry but still cannot reach external systems — GitHub, Microsoft Learn, or third-party APIs. That's Challenge 04.
