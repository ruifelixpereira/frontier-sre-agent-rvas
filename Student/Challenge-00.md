# Challenge 00 — Prerequisites: Deploy the Lab and Create Your SRE Agent

## Introduction

Before the learning starts, three things must exist: your own fork of this repository, the Azure lab infrastructure, and your SRE Agent. This challenge takes care of all three.

You'll deploy the workload infrastructure with Terraform and then create your own Azure SRE Agent — an empty agent with no skills, no knowledge, no subagents, and no connectors. That emptiness is intentional. In Challenges 01 through 06 you will add each capability yourself, one at a time, and observe exactly what each addition unlocks. By the end of Challenge 06 you'll have built the fully configured agent from scratch — and you'll understand every piece of it.

The lab infrastructure includes: a hub-spoke network with Azure Firewall, IaaS VMs running a web/API/DB tier, VNet Flow Logs with Traffic Analytics, the **Grubify** food-ordering app on Azure Container Apps, and the containerized **Parking Manager** frontend on a public Azure Web App. The Parking Manager frontend, Madrid VM, and Paris VM share a dedicated Parking VNet, isolated from the Web/API IaaS VNets and their NSGs and routes. This VNet is not peered with the hub and does not use the firewall; the VMs use their own NAT Gateway for outbound access, while the frontend uses a UDR-free integration subnet to reach the private VM-hosted APIs. All of this is provisioned by Terraform — the SRE Agent creation and configuration are entirely up to you.

## Description

### Step 1 — Fork and clone the repository

Sign in to GitHub and open the canonical workshop repository:

[https://github.com/microsoft/frontier-sre-agent-rvas](https://github.com/microsoft/frontier-sre-agent-rvas)

1. Select **Fork** in the upper-right corner.
2. Choose your GitHub account as the owner and select **Create fork**.
3. On your fork, select **Code** and copy its HTTPS URL.
4. Clone your fork and enter the repository directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git
   cd frontier-sre-agent-rvas
   ```

5. Add Microsoft's canonical repository as the `upstream` remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git
   git remote -v
   ```

Confirm that `origin` points to your fork and `upstream` points to the Microsoft repository:

```text
origin    https://github.com/<your-github-username>/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/<your-github-username>/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/microsoft/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/microsoft/frontier-sre-agent-rvas.git (push)
```

Keep your fork as `origin`. Later challenges derive `GRUBIFY_REPO_URL` from the `origin` remote so
the SRE Agent works with a repository where you can push branches and open pull requests. Use
`upstream` to fetch updates from Microsoft's canonical repository.

### Step 2 — Authenticate

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"
```

### Step 3 — Deploy the lab workload infrastructure

From the `Student/` directory:

```bash
cd Student && make deploy
```

The default deployment location is `swedencentral`. To deploy to a different Azure region, pass
the Terraform `location` variable through `TF_VARS`:

```bash
cd Student && make deploy TF_VARS='-var="location=your_preferred_region_here"'
```

This runs `terraform init` + `terraform apply` against the Student Terraform root at `Student/Resources/infra/`, then points the Grubify and Parking Manager container apps at the published images. It provisions the workload only. Creating the Azure SRE Agent is your job, in Step 4.

> First-time deployment takes approximately **15–20 minutes**. The Container Apps environment is the slowest resource to provision.

### Step 4 — Create your Azure SRE Agent

Before creating the agent, ensure the `Microsoft.App` resource provider is registered in your subscription:

```bash
az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.App"
```

Create the agent yourself in the **SRE Agent portal**. It is deliberately not part of the Terraform
you just applied: building it, and then filling it with capabilities in Challenges 01 to 06, is the
point of this workshop.

1. Go to [https://sre.azure.com](https://sre.azure.com) and sign in.
2. Create an agent in a resource group of your choice, in the same region as the
   workload you just deployed (e.g., the default is **Sweden Central**, but you can choose another region if desired).
3. Confirm that its provisioning state is `Succeeded` and its power state is `Running`.
4. Associate all workload resource groups with the agent and give it **Contributor** permission.
5. Print the resource groups the agent must watch, from the `Student/` directory:

   ```bash
   terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" output hub_resource_group_name
   terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" output web_api_resource_group_name
   terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" output data_resource_group_name
   terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" output sample_food_resource_group_name
   terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" output parking_resource_groups
   ```

   The certified profile is scoped to:
   - `rg-sre-hub-connectivity` — hub network, Azure Firewall, Bastion, and shared observability
   - `rg-sre-spoke-web-api-iaas` — client and web VMs
   - `rg-sre-spoke-data-iaas` — API and database VMs
   - `rg-sre-spoke-foodapp-paas` — Sample Food / Grubify Container Apps
   - `rg-sre-parking-lisbon` — Lisbon Parking API
   - `rg-sre-parking-berlin` — Berlin Parking API and MCP server
   - `rg-sre-parking-madrid` — Madrid Parking VM
   - `rg-sre-parking-paris` — Paris Parking VM
   - `rg-sre-parking-chaos` — Chaos Control and VM Health Control
   - `rg-sre-parking-frontend` — public Parking Manager Web App and App Service plan

The network analyst and the proactive scheduled tasks stay read-only even though the agent holds
broader permissions for the remediation scenarios.

### Step 5 — Configure your .env file

Every `make` target that talks to the agent needs to know where it is. Record it once:

```bash
cd Student
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in SRE_AGENT_RG and SRE_AGENT_NAME
```

### Step 6 — Generate baseline telemetry data

Start traffic generation so monitoring data exists before you reach the operational challenges:

```bash
make baseline-traffic
make food-traffic
make parking-traffic
```

`make baseline-traffic` runs a traffic burst on the IaaS VMs via a remote run-command (takes 2–4 minutes). `make food-traffic` hits the Grubify API endpoints. `make parking-traffic` sends requests through the public Parking Manager frontend to the Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, and Berlin APIs and the control services.

### Step 7 — Validate the lab

```bash
# Lab infrastructure health
make validate
make validate-food
make validate-parking
```

## Pre-flight Validation Checklist

Before continuing to Challenge 01, confirm every check below passes:

```bash
# 1. This checkout uses your fork as origin and Microsoft as upstream
git remote -v

# 2. Azure CLI is installed and authenticated
az account show --query "{name:name,id:id,state:state}" -o table

# 3. Terraform is installed
terraform -chdir="Resources/infra" version

# 4. GitHub CLI is installed (needed from Challenge 01 onwards)
gh --version

# 5. Lab infrastructure is healthy
make validate
make validate-food
make validate-parking
```

All validation commands must succeed before proceeding. If `make validate` fails, re-run `make deploy`. If `make validate-food` fails, run `make food-status` to check the Grubify Container Apps revision state. If `make validate-parking` fails, review the reported Web App configuration or unhealthy proxy endpoint before continuing.

## Success Criteria

1. You created your own fork, with your fork configured as `origin` and the Microsoft repository as `upstream`
2. `make deploy` completes successfully and all workload resources are provisioned
3. You created the SRE Agent yourself and the portal loads it
4. All lab resource groups are associated with the agent in the portal
5. The agent permission level is **Contributor**
6. `Student/.env` is configured with your `SRE_AGENT_RG` and `SRE_AGENT_NAME`
7. `make validate`, `make validate-food`, and `make validate-parking` return healthy
8. **Explain to your coach** — why does the SRE Agent require Contributor permission instead of Reader? What specific actions in later challenges require write access, and what governance controls prevent the agent from taking unconstrained write actions?

## Tips

- Run **only** `make deploy` here.
