# Deploy the workload — the hub-spoke network, demo VMs, Sample Food (Grubify)
# app, and the Parking app. This is the infrastructure the Azure SRE Agent will
# observe and manage.
#
# The Azure SRE Agent itself is deliberately not declared here. Creating it is the
# participant's job in Challenge 00, and it starts empty: skills, knowledge,
# subagents and connectors are added from Challenge 01 onwards. Record the agent's
# resource group and name in Student/.env so the make targets can reach it.
